- [ ] The splash screen and the initial screen have four asteroids.

- [ ] There is a on-screen display showing lives remaining, level, and score.  The ship gets three lives initially.

- [ ] The ship does not move autonomously.  Instead, you can accelerate it in the direction it is pointing with the up-arrow or W key.  There is a maximum speed to which a ship can accelerate.

- [ ] You can turn left with either the left-arrow or A key.  You can turn right with either the right-arrow or D key.

- [ ] When you accelerate the ship, a small flame is animated.

- [ ] You can fire bullets by pressing the down-arrow, S, or space key.  There can be at most eight bullets flying around at any given time.  A bullet disappears when it hits something or when it has reached its maximum range.

- [ ] When a large asteroid collides with a bullet or a ship, the asteroid splits into two medium asteroids.  When a medium asteroid collides, it splits into two small asteroids.  When a small asteroid collides, it disappears.

- [ ] Transient "dust" appears briefly when an asteroid splits or disappears.

- [ ] Transient "debris" appears briefly when the ship is hit.

- [ ] The game score goes up by 20 points when a large asteroid splits, by 50 points when a medium asteroid splits, and by 100 points when a small asteroid disappears.

- [ ] At the beginning of the game, four large asteroids are placed in the vicinity of the four corners of the screen.  The exact position is randomly chosen, as is the rotation and direction of the asteroid.  There are three speed limits for asteroids: slow, medium, and fast.  A large-sized asteroid always has the slow speed.  A medium-sized asteroid has a randomly chosen speed that lies between slow and medium.  A small-size asteroid has a randomly chosen speed that lies between slow and fast.

- [ ] Each time a new level is reached (i.e., each time all the asteroids on the screen are destroyed), new large asteroids appear.  The number of these large asteroids increases by one from the previous level.  At the beginning of the game, there are four large asteroids; at level 2, there are five; at level 3, there are six; and so on.

- [ ] Ship rotation and thruster firing work smoothly in the complete game.  The controls in the stripped-down game are very awkward by comparison.

- [ ] At level 2, a medium size alien ship appears 5-10 seconds after the level begins.  It follows a zig-zag path, periodically firing bullets in random directions.  It starts off screen and goes in a direction either left-to-right or right-to-left across the screen.  It randomly zig-zags in three directions: either perfectly horizontal, or at a slight angle one radian upward or downward from horizontal.  When it is destroyed, you earn 200 points.  About 5-10 seconds later, it appears again.

- [ ] At level 3 and above, the medium alien ship stops appearing and the small alien ship appears instead.  The small alien ship zig-zags the same as the medium alien ship, but moves faster and fires bullets toward the ship.  (Specifically, it fires in a randomly chosen direction that is within five degrees of the direction of the center of the ship.)  Its destruction earns you 1000 points.

- [ ] There are complete sound effects.
